# Desing for Extension

+ Design for easy extension
+ Adhere to the Open-Closed Principle(OCP) to keep code open for extension, but closed for modification.
+ Design for code additions by means of base classes, templates, function overloading or template specialization.
+ Avoid premature abstraction if you are not sure about the next addtion.
