# Design for change

+ Expect change in Software
+ Design for easy change
+ Avoid combing unrelated, orthogonal aspects in the same class to prevent coupling
+ Understand that coupling increases the likehood for change and makes changes harder.
+ Adhere to the Single-Responsibility Principle(SRP) to separate concerns.
+ Follow the Don't Repeat Yourself(DRY) principle to minimize duplication.
+ Avoid premature abstraction if you are not sure about the next change.
